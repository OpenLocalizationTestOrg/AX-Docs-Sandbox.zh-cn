This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger. 

In General ledger, you can complete closing procedures for a period or a year. Closing processes prepare the system for a new period. To prepare the system for a new year, you must run the year end close process. Each organization has different processes and steps that it performs for the end of a period. Here are some optional steps for period ends:

-   Complete all the tasks for all other modules, such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Inventory.
-   Verify that all journals are posted.
-   Run foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts.
-   Settle transactions for each ledger account.
-   Process any required allocations.
-   Manually post period-end adjustments.
-   Journalize transactions, and review the **Ledger journal** report.
-   Perform a consolidation by using a consolidation company or Financial reporting.
-   Generate period-end financial statements by using Financial reporting.
-   Set ledger periods to **On hold**, so that no further posting occurs. You can also restrict a period to a specific user group while period-end activities are occurring, for better control. It's not a good idea to set periods to **Permanently closed**, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed.

The Financial period close workspace can be used to organize and track the tasks required for various period end processes. Refer to the [Financial period close workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/general-ledger/financial-period-close-workspace)topic for additional information.
