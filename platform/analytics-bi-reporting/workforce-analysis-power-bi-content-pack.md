# <a name="workforce-metrics-content-pack-for-power-bi"></a>Workforce Metrics content pack for Power BI

This topic describes the Dynamics 365 for Operations - Workforce Metrics content pack for Power BI. It explains how to access the reports that are included in the content pack, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content pack.

<a name="accessing-the-content-pack"></a>Accessing the content pack
--------------------------

You can find the Workforce Metrics content pack in the Shared assets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information about how to download the content pack and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md).

## <a name="reports-that-are-included-in-the-content-pack"></a>Reports that are included in the content pack
After you’ve connected the content pack to your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, the reports show your organization’s data. If you’ve never used Microsoft Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The reports that are included in the content pack have both charts and tables that contain additional information. The following table describes the reports.

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. These calculated measures are then used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. If you want to include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can download and modify the CompensationandBenefits.pbix file from LCS. This file is the default data model that was used to create the content pack. After you've made modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.
