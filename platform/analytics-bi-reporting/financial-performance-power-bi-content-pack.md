# <a name="financial-performance-content-pack-for-power-bi"></a>Financial Performance content pack for Power BI

This topic describes the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations Financial Performance content pack for Microsoft Power BI. It describes the dashboard and reports that are included in the content pack, and provides information about the data model and entities that were used to build the content pack.

<a name="accessing-the-content-pack"></a>Accessing the content pack
--------------------------

Two versions of the Financial Performance content pack are available. One version is available from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), and the other is available from PowerBI.com.

-   **Version that is available from LCS:** The Financial Performance content pack that is available from LCS supports Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611. You can find the content pack in the Shared asset library in LCS. For more information about how to download the content pack and connect it to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Power BI content in LCS from Microsoft and your partners](power-bi-content-microsoft-partners.md).
-   **Version that is available from PowerBI.com:** The Financial Performance content pack that is available from PowerBI.com supports Microsoft Dynamics AX versions 7.0 and 7.0.1. For more information about how to connect and load your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, see [Access Power BI content from PowerBI.com](power-bi-home-page.md#access-power-bi-content-from-powerbi-com).

## <a name="main-account-setup"></a>Main account setup
Because organizations want liabilities and revenue amounts to appear as positive amounts on reports, the setup of the main accounts in Dynamics 365 for Operations is important. For these main accounts to appear as positive amounts, the main account type must be set to **Liability** or **Revenue**. When these account types are used, reporting through Microsoft Power BI will reverse the signs and show the amounts as positive.

## <a name="dashboard-and-reports-that-are-included-in-the-content-pack"></a>Dashboard and reports that are included in the content pack
After you’ve connected the content pack to your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, the dashboard and reports show your financial data. If you’ve never used Power BI before, you can learn more about it on the [Guided Learning page for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/?WT.mc_id=PBIService_GetData). The dashboard contains summarized tiles of data that are based on underlying reports. Each tile contains summarized information for the current year across all companies in an organization. Here are some of the tiles:

-   Cash
-   Total Revenue this year
-   Total Expenses this year
-   Net Income this year
-   Quick Ratio
-   Total Expenses this year by account category
-   Current Ratio
-   Debt to Total Assets
-   Actual vs Forecasted Revenue
-   Billed Revenue this Year
-   Operating expenses Ratio this year
-   Profit Margin this year
-   Actual vs Budget Expenses – All companies

Each tile is backed by a supporting report. These reports contain both charts and tables that provide more information. The following table describes the reports.

| Report                      | Information that the report contains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The charts and tiles on all these reports can be filtered and pinned to the dashboard. For more information about how to filter and pin in Power BI, see [Create and Configure a Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/powerbi-learning-4-2-create-configure-dashboards).

## <a name="understanding-the-data-model-and-entities"></a>Understanding the data model and entities
The data that populates the dashboard and reports in the Financial Performance content pack is Dynamics 365 for Operations data. The following entities were used as the basis of the content pack: **Aggregate data entities**

-   **GeneralLedgerActivities** – This entity aggregates general ledger balances by account category.
-   **BudgetActivities** – This entity aggregates budget balances by account category.

**Data entities**

-   FiscalCalendars
-   MainAccounts
-   LegalEntities
-   Ledgers
-   ChartofAccounts

These entities were used to create calculated measures in the data model. The calculated measures are used to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and reports that are used in the content pack. By default, the content pack brings in data for the last three years and one future year. To include additional calculations on your reports and dashboard, you can modify the [Microsoft Excel workbook](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/global/AX/downloads/reports/msdaxfinpercontentpowerbi). This workbook is the default data model that was used to create the content pack. After you've finished making your modifications, you can create an organizational content pack and dashboard that contain the information that you’ve added.
