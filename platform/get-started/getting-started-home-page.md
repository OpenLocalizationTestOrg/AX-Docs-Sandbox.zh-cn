### <a name="task-recordings-and-task-guides"></a>Task recordings and Task guides

Task Recorder is a Dynamics 365 for Operations tool that you can use to record the actions that you take in the user interface (UI). When you create a *task recording*, all events that are executed against the server are recorded as you perform them in the UI. These events include adding values, changing settings, and removing data. A *Task guide* is a controlled, guided, interactive experience that leads you through the steps of a task recording. You can open (or *play*) a task guide from the Help system.
