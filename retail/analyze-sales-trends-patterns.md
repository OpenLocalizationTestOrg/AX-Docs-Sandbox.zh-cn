You can study sales trends and patterns in real time in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations - Retail.

Users can also study sales trends and patterns by hour across different levels of the organization hierarchy over a selected period by using the out-of-box **Channel sales by hour** report. You can open this report from any of the following locations:
