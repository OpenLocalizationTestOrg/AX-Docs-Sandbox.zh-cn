This topic gives a list of the help topics and other resources that are available for Warehouse management.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations has two warehouse solutions: "Inventory management" warehousing or "Basic warehousing", which is available in the Inventory management module, and the "Advanced" warehousing solution that's available in the Warehouse management module. This topic provides an overview of the resources that are available in the Warehouse management module. For information about Inventory management warehousing, see the [Inventory management home page](inventory-management.md).

## <a name="warehouse-management-overview"></a>Warehouse management overview
Use the functionality in the Warehouse management module to monitor and automate warehouse processes. The Warehouse management module lets you manage warehouse processes in manufacturing, distribution, and retail companies. For example, you can use the features in this module to complete tasks in the following areas.

-   Workflows - Configure inbound and outbound intelligent workflows.
-   Picking and packing - Assign orders to clusters to pick from a single location and configure profiles to control the validation and packing of items into shipping containers. Alternate between picking strategies for batch and non-batch items.
-   Wave processing - Create, implement, and release work using batch-scheduled or manual processing of waves.
-   Inventory counting - Set up cycle counting thresholds, create cycle counting plans, schedule plans, and cycle count locations and items ad hoc.
-   Containerization - Set up container groups to order the sequence of the packing process and create templates to support packing strategies.
-   Mobile devices - Use scanners or other mobile devices to optimize precision in the picking and put-away processes.

There are also many topics about advanced warehousing on the [Supply Chain Management ](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/)blog. Most of these were written for the previous version of Dynamics 365 for Operations, but the same concepts still apply, and the procedures are similar in the current version. For example, there are posts about:
